# Risk-Benefit and Genomic Epidemiology Intenship at Technical University of Denmark (DTU) ðŸ‘©ðŸ’»

This repository includes the data and the analysis I performed during my master dissertation project in the risk-benefit and genomic epidemiology units at DTU. This work was developed during 4 months, between January and May 2021.

### Classic QMRA
#### Data  ðŸ“”
<ul>
  <li><a href = 'https://github.com/Raquel-Costa/intern_dtu/blob/main/classic_QMRA/serra_da_estrela_cheese.xlsx'>Serra da Estrela Cheese</a> - data regarding the product at retail level and consumer habits</li>
  <li><a href='https://github.com/Raquel-Costa/intern_dtu/blob/main/classic_QMRA/population_pt.csv'>Population in Portugal between 2012 and 2020</a> - data of the number of portuguese population by year and by age</li>
</ul>


#### Analysis Performed ðŸ•µ
<ul>
  <li><a href = 'https://github.com/Raquel-Costa/intern_dtu/blob/main/classic_QMRA/gQMRA.R'>Classic QMRA</a> - QMRA performed on Serra da Estrela cheese data, based on <a href = 'https://github.com/Raquel-Costa/intern_dtu/tree/main/classic_QMRA/original_EFSA'>EFSA QMRA for L.monocytogenes in RTE food products (gQMRA)</a></li>
  <li><a href='https://github.com/Raquel-Costa/intern_dtu/blob/main/classic_QMRA/population_pt.R'>Population in Portugal between 2012 and 2020</a> - analysis to get the average yearly portuguese population by age group</li>
</ul>

### QMRA based on genomic data
#### Data  ðŸ“”
<ul>
  <li><a href = 'https://github.com/Raquel-Costa/intern_dtu/blob/main/genomic_data_QMRA/genomic_data.xlsx'>Cheese WGS samples</a> - whole genome sequencing data and additional information from cheese samples obtained from NCBI database and ENA browser. The excel file contains multiple sheets:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>wgs_cheese_environ_multi â€“ cheese, environmental and multi-ingredient samples available (all related to cheese)</li>
    <li>wgs_cheese â€“ cheese only samples available </li>
    <li>wgs_data_download â€“ samples downloaded to computerome</li>
    <li>assembly_QC - quality control metrics after assembly</li>
    <li>high_quality - assembled samples with less than 500 contigs</li>
    <li>low_quality â€“ assembled samples with more than 500 contigs</li>
    <li>metadata_tree â€“ auxiliar data regarding the samples to use on PHYLOViZ Online to build the tree</li>

</ul>
