# Risk-Benefit and Genomic Epidemiology Intenship at Technical University of Denmark (DTU) ðŸ‘©ðŸ’»

This repository includes the data and the analysis I performed during my master dissertation project in the risk-benefit and genomic epidemiology units at DTU. This work was developed during 4 months, between January and May 2021.

### Classic QMRA
